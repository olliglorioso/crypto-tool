1. If you have Docker and docker-compose installed, just run \
  ``docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml`` \
  in the root folder, it should work. Then localhosts are:\
  frontend: http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:8080 \
  backend: http://localhost:4000/graphql or http://localhost:8080/api
3. Run following commands in the root folder: \
``npm run start:frontend`` \
``npm run start:backend`` \
Now you can access frontend in localhost:3000 and backend in localhost:4000/graphql
